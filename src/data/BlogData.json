In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the core concepts of React and build a practical application from scratch.\n\n## What is React?\n\nReact is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly web applications. It was developed by Facebook and has become one of the most popular frontend frameworks.\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state\n- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient updates and rendering\n- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: Use React for web, mobile, and desktop applications\n\n## Setting Up Your Development Environment\n\nBefore we start coding, let's set up our development environment:\n\n```bash\nnpx create-react-app my-first-app\ncd my-first-app\nnpm start\n```\n\n## Creating Your First Component\n\nLet's create a simple component:\n\n```jsx\nfunction Welcome(props) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;\n}\n```\n\nThis is just the beginning of your React journey.

Modern CSS offers powerful features that make creating beautiful, responsive designs easier than ever.\n\n## CSS Grid Layout\n\nCSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that gives you complete control over your layouts:\n\n```css\n.container {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));\n  gap: 2rem;\n}\n```\n\n## Flexbox for One-Dimensional Layouts\n\nFlexbox is perfect for arranging items in a single direction:\n\n```css\n.flex-container {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: space-between;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n```\n\n## CSS Custom Properties (Variables)\n\nCustom properties make your CSS more maintainable:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --primary-color: #3498db;\n  --secondary-color: #2ecc71;\n}\n\n.button {\n  background-color: var(--primary-color);\n}\n```\n\nThese modern techniques will help you create more efficient and maintainable stylesheets."
